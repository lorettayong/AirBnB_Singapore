# Introduction

Hi there!

As a novice to the glorious world of technology, I have been taking short online courses to learn much more than what I have learnt in IBM's i.am-vitalize (AI Track) programme. Upon completing my self-studying of some basic Tableau techniques (all credits go to [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTheAnalyst), I was strongly inspired and motivated to create my very first interactive dashboard and include it in my technical portfolio, so <i>voila</i>!

The primary objective of this data visualisation is to provide a simple yet helpful overview of all AirBnB listings in Singapore. I had used Tableau Public to develop this dashboard, working with AirBnB dataset taken from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). The data was last compiled on 26 December 2021.

For anyone who would like to explore the various charts featured in the dashboard, please visit the interactive version [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/AirBnBinSingapore/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

This may be my first attempt in using Tableau, but it will not be my last. If I have made any errors, it is of my own fault.

Thank you for your time.
