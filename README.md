# Introduction

Hi there!

As a novice to the magnificant world of technology, I have been taking short online courses to build up on what I have learnt in IBM's i.am-vitalize (AI Track) programme. Upon completing my self-studying of some basic Tableau techniques (my heartfelt thanks to [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTheAnalyst), I was strongly inspired and motivated to create my very first interactive dashboard and include it in my technical portfolio, so <i>voila</i>!

The primary objective of this data visualisation is to provide a simple yet helpful overview of all AirBnB listings in Singapore. I used Tableau Public to develop this dashboard, and worked with AirBnB dataset taken from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). The data was last compiled on 26 December 2021.

For anyone who would like to access the various charts featured in the dashboard and explore further, please have a look at the interactive version [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/AirBnBinSingapore/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) or download the Tableau workbook found in this repository.

This may be my first attempt in using Tableau, but it will not be my last. :)

Thank you for your time.
